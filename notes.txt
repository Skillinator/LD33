Notes

Current ToDo stack:
Implement Registry based creation of Components
Implement IOManager reading 
Implement file-based loading of resources (Textures, color schemes, etc)
  IOManager should have load method
Implement text rendering
Implement keyboard input and binding
Implement dev console
Implement hitboxes
Implement collisions

Notes:
May want to stop unnecessary function calls for non-update systems
May want to add range class for easy load/unload of resources?
  Perhaps a "Collection" class that holds the ranges for all resource types (Graphics, Audio, etc.)


System: IOManager loads Collections

Collections store entity definitions and sfx in an easy to load/unload format

Entities store sound effects, component lists, animations

Animations store metadata (fps, frame numbers, base (ex. "brickWallBuild" would be the base for the animation "brickWallBuild01" to "brickWallBuild60"))
